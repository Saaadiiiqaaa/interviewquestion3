        <h1>What are promises? why do we need them </h1>
           <p> promise is a javascript object that links both producing code and consuming code<br>
        producing code is the code that take some time <br>
    consuming code is the code that waits for the results<br>
   java script promise object can be pending,fulfilled or rejected
while promise is in pending state ....it results in undefined<br>
whuile promise is in fulfilled state...it results in a value<br>
while promise is i9n rejected satte....it results in a error</p>
<pre>
    let mypromise=   new Promise (function(res,rej){
        let x=2;
        if(x>1){
            res("true")
        }
        else{
            rej("false")
        }
    });
    mypromise.then(
        function(value){console.log(value);},
        function(error){console.log(error);}
    );
    <p>promises is used to handle the asynchronous javascript earlier callbacks were used but multiple <br>
        callbacks would creat callback hell leading to unmanageable code due to which promises were introduce to make simpler code</p>

        <h1>what is promise chaining?</h1>
        <p>
           promise chaining is a technique used to perform series of asynchronous operations<br>
           in an specific order using promises ,it invloves multiple .then method on a promise to <br>
           handle the result and return a new promise for the next operation in the chain
                  
        </p>
        <pre>
            function mypromise(alpha,time){
            return new Promise((res)=>{
             setTimeout(()=>{
                console.log(alpha);
                res("prmsie resolved ");
             },time)
            })
            
            }
            function alphafunc(){
                mypromise("a",2000)
                .then(()=>mypromise("i",3000))
                .then(()=>mypromise("e"),1000)
            }
            alphafunc()</pre>

    <div><h1>what is DOM</h1>
    <p> when a web page is loaded a browser create a
         Document object model The DOM is a tree-like structure, with each node in the tree <br>
         representing a different part of the document. The root node of the tree represents the entire document, <br>
         and the child nodes of the root node represent the different elements of the document.</p></div> 
    <div><h1>what are closures<h1>
    <p>
        closures rae the js feature where inner functions has acces to the outer functions's variable<br>
        it has three scope chains :-<br>
        1. acces to its own scope <br>
        2.access to outer function scope <br>
        3. acces to global variable
    </p>
<pre>
    let a=20;
function outerfiunc(){
    let b=7;
    function innerfunc(){
        let c=8;
        console.log(c);
        console.log(b);
        console.log(a);
    }
    innerfunc()

    <div> <h1>what are different operators in js ?</h1>
    <P> arithmatic operators---> +,-,/,*<br>
    assingnment operators---> =,+=,-=,/=,*=<br>
comparizon operators--->==,===,>,<,!=,!==<br>
logical operators--> &&,||,!<br>
bitwise operator-->&,|,~,^,<<,>></p>

        <div><h1>what are objects in js </h1>
        <p>objects is a conatiner for name values called properties and method  </p>
       <pre>
        const person={
            name:"sadiqa",
            batch:"ea23",
            age:23
        };
       </pre>
    <p>different ways to create objects are <br>
        using object literals:- let person={name:"hello",age:23};
        using new keyword:- const person =new Object(); person.name="sadiqa";person.age=23;
